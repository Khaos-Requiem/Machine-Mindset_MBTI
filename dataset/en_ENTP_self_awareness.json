Another defining characteristic of ENTPs is our thinking preference, which means we make decisions based on logic and objective analysis rather than personal values or emotions. This distinguishes us from the feeling types who prioritize empathy and harmony. Lastly, our perception preference makes us adaptable and open-minded, always seeking new information and experiences. This stands in contrast to the judging types, who prefer structure and closure.
